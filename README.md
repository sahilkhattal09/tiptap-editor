Tiptap Editor with Pagination and Page Breaks
Overview

This project is a React-based prototype of a Tiptap-powered rich text editor with visual pagination and per-page headers/footers designed to mimic an A4 document layout. It supports manual and automatic page breaks and ensures page structure is preserved during print/export.

The target users are lawyers, requiring clear page boundaries and structured document formatting.
Features

    Visual A4 page layout: Multiple pages are rendered with realistic dimensions (210mm x 297mm), borders, and shadows.

    Manual page breaks: Users can insert page breaks via the editor toolbar, represented as horizontal rules.

    Automatic pagination: Content is dynamically split into pages using a custom pagination hook, ensuring content fits within page boundaries.

    Headers and footers: Each page displays a header (document title) and a footer (page numbers) that update dynamically.

    Print/export support: CSS media queries apply page breaks and layout styling to preserve the page structure during printing or PDF export.

    Zoom and font controls: Users can adjust zoom level, font size, and font family for better readability.

Implementation Details

    Built with React and Tiptap for a modern, extensible rich-text editing experience.

    The usePagination hook measures rendered content and splits it into multiple pages based on height constraints.

    Page breaks are visually represented and synchronized with editor content updates.

    Headers and footers are rendered in the React tree and styled for on-screen and print views.

    The editor supports common formatting extensions: bold, italic, underline, text alignment, and headings.

Constraints & Trade-offs

    Prototype focus: The project focuses on a working prototype rather than a production-ready product.

    Performance: Automatic pagination recalculates on every content update which may affect performance for very large documents.

    Complex content: Support for images, tables, and nested blocks is limited in this version and may cause pagination inaccuracies.

    Print/export: While basic print styling is included, full-featured PDF export would require a dedicated solution or external library.

    Responsiveness: Layout is optimized for desktop and larger screens; mobile responsiveness and accessibility are not fully addressed here.

How to Run

    Clone the repository

    Install dependencies with npm install or yarn

    Run the development server with npm run dev or yarn dev

    Open http://localhost:3000 to view the editor prototype

How to Productionize

    Optimize pagination logic for performance using memoization or throttling.

    Enhance support for complex content types (images, tables, lists).

    Add undo/redo and versioning features for editing robustness.

    Improve accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

    Implement PDF export with proper page breaks, headers, and footers using libraries like jsPDF, pdf-lib, or server-side rendering.

    Add user preferences for default fonts, page sizes, and styles.

    Integrate backend autosave and collaboration features.
